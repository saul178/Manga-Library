# Manga-Library
This is a project in where the goal is to learn Golang, API's, REST, and how to create the backend and frontend of a website.
The idea of the project is to create a library in where the user can store the manga(books) into the website and have visual representation of what they own.
This was made in mind for my problem of forgetting what I own and accidentaly buying the same book more then once.
