# Manga-Library
This is a project in where the goal is to learn Golang, API's, REST, and how to create the backend/frontend of a website.
The idea of the project is to create a library in where the user can store their manga(books) into the website and have a visual representation of what they own.
This was made in mind for my problem of forgetting what I own and accidentaly buying the same book more then once.
